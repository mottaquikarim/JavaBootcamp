# Java

Java is a multipurpose language used for desktop, web, mobile, servers, game, database connection, and more. It was created in 1995, and today, over 3 billion devices run Java.

## Key Java Terms

* `JAR (Java Archive)`: JAR is a platform-independent file format that aggregates many files into one. Multiple Java applets and their components (.class files, images, etc.) can be bundled in a JAR file and subsequently downloaded to a browser in a single HTTP transaction.
* `Java Development Kit (JDK)`: A software development environment for writing applets and application in the Java programming language.
* `Java Runtime Environment (JRE)`: A subset of the JDK for end-users and developers who want to redistribute the runtime environment. The Java runtime environment consists of the JVM, the Java core classes, and supporting files.
* `interpreter`: A module that alternately decodes and executes every statement in a body of code.
* `compiler`: A program to translate Java source code into bytecode for the JVM such that a computer can execute it. Once done, it saves it in a `.class` file.
* `Java Virtual Machine (JVM)`: The part of the JRE that acts as an interpreter for bytecodes.
* `bytecode`: Machine-independent code generated by the Java compiler and executed by the Java interpreter.
