# Essential Terminology

ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡


## Define: Program

Discrete, highly logical and explicit instructions that are parsed and executed by a computer.
We call this set of human-readable instructions **source code**, or colloquially, a **computer program**.

**Compilers** can take this source code and transform it into **machine code**, a representation of the source that can be executed by the computer's **central processing unit** or **CPU**. 

Not all programs are compiled though, some are **interpreted**. The difference is that compiled languages need a step where the source code is physically transformed into machine code. However, with an interpreted language, this additional step is **excluded** in favor of **parsing** and **executing** the source code directly when the program is run.


## How are programs written?

All programs are composed with a collection of **fundamental** concepts that, when combined, can essentially dictate a wide variety of tasks a computer can perform.


### **Declarations**

Typically, we can store and retrieve data in our programs by associating them with intermediary values that we call **variables**


### **Expressions**

We use expressions to evaluate stuff. For example, **`2 + 2`** is an example of an expression that will **evaluate** a value, namely 4. 

**NOTE**: typically we can use expressions and declarations in tandem to perform complex tasks. For instance, we can reference a variable we declared in an expression to help us evaluate new values which can then be stored.

### **Statements**

Statements will use expressions and declarations to alternate a program's **control flow**, which is essentially the order in which declarations, expressions, and other statements are executed.

### Algorithms

Aside from these fundamental concepts, we also talk a lot about this idea of **algorithms**. An **algorithm** is simply a series of declarations, expressions, and statements that can be used over and over again to solve well defined problems of a certain type.

For example, we can implement an algorithm that converts temperature from **fahrenheit** to **celsius**. It would look something like this:
1. **Declare** F = 32;
2. **Expression** ( **F** - 32 ) / 1.8;
3. **Declare** C = **Evaluated** expression from **[2]**

This is a form of **pseudo** code where we define the steps a computer program &mdash; **any** &mdash; computer program can take to convert **fahrenheit** to **celsius**.

The beauty of programming is that all of it revolves around the same key set of concepts and ideas. For this reason, we do not need to specify any **particular programming language** when discussing the functional aspects of a program.

## Define: Programming languages

A programming language is a series of **grammar** and **rules** that we can define towards writing source code.

Languages are effectively different approaches towards communicating the same ideas in programming. Essentially, we can communicate in say both **French** and **English**, what mainly differs is the structure of our sentences and the actual words and sounds themselves.
The **same analogy** can be made with programming languages.


## Examples of programming languages


1. **JavaScript**: this language is interpreted.
2. **Python**: this language is interpreted.
3. **Java**: this language is compiled
4. **Ruby**: this language is interpreted.
5. **C/C++**: this language is compiled.

These languages all build on the same concepts defined above; the main difference lies in **how** they are run (compiled vs interpreted) and also **how** they are used. 
In general, anything programmable can be programmed in each of the languages defined above. However, some languages are better suited for certain tasks above others. 
For example, to perform web programming on the front-end, you'll want to write JavaScript. This is because all browsers collectively support running javascript within it's environment. 


## Psuedo Code

Let's build a thermostat.

**Assumptions**

1. We store user designated temperature value and don't worry about how to get the input
2. There is a statement we can run to query current room temperature
3. There is a statement we can run to start / stop a "heat" source

## You Do

Built a simple text based Rock Paper Scissors game.

Two variables; p1 and p2.

Expected output: winner = [whomever won, p1 or p2]
