# Our First Java Program

**SPOILER**: it prints out `Hello, Wrold!`

## First, the code.

```java
public class HelloWrold {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, Wrold!");
	}
}

## Some key insights

* `class`: As defined earlier, we write Java by defining and executing classes
* `main`: This is a class method (albeit a special one). It is the "main" method of this class or in other words, the "entry point" of our program. Java knows to run this method when we call it.
* `System`: a pre-defined class provided by Java with methods and variables attached to it
